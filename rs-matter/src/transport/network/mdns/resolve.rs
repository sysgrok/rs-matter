/// An mDNS responder for Matter utilizing the systemd-resolved daemon over DBus.
///
/// Note that typically Ubuntu Desktop and other desktop distros - while distributing and running `systemd-resolved` -
/// do not have mDNS enabled by default in it and instead do have the Avahi daemon running by default. So during development,
/// you might just want to use the Avahi mDNS responder instead, which is also available in the `zbus` feature.
///
/// To use this responder, you need to have your `systemd-resolved` daemon installed, running and configured with
/// mDNS enabled - also on the particular network interface(s) where you want mDNS multicasting. Doing so usually requires:
/// - Stopping and/or uninstalling the avahi daemon if it is installed and running (e.g. `sudo service avahi-daemon stop`)
/// - Eabling mDNS in the systemd-resolved configuration file, usually located at `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` (`MulticastDNS=yes`)
///   and then restarting the daemon (e.g. `sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved`).
/// - Enabling mDNS on the network interface(s) you want to use, by e.g. running `sudo resolvectl mdns eno0 yes`
///   (you can check all is well by e.g. running `sudo resolvectl status eno1` after that)
/// - See also https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/459991/how-to-configure-systemd-resolved-for-mdns-multicast-dns-on-local-network
///   for more details
///
/// NOTE: If you are greeted with an
/// "Error: Error::DBusError: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.InteractiveAuthorizationRequired: Interactive authentication required."
/// message, this is an indication that the Linux user on behalf of which you are running the app does not have the elevated privileges
/// required by the systemd-resolved daemon so as to register mDNS services.
///
/// For testing, easiest is to run the application with `sudo` or as root.
